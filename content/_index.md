# Software-Defined Networking with AWS
#### Overview

This lab is a hands-on guide to implementing Software-Defined Networking (SDN) concepts on Amazon Web Services (AWS). You will build a complete, event-driven network automation solution that demonstrates programmatic control, dynamic routing, and policy-based network management. The project focuses on creating a high-availability web service with an automated failover mechanism using AWS Lambda, CloudWatch, and EventBridge to manage an Elastic IP address. This will provide you with a practical understanding of how to build resilient and self-healing network architectures in the cloud.
